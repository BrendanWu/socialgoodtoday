                  <p>Social Good Today is a student run nonprofit organization aimed to raise awareness and establish real change within our most vulnerable groups and communities. Based in Toronto with plans to expand internationally, SGT recognizes the need for our most marginalized voices to be amplified and heard.
In partnering with local foundations and causes with a similar vision in mind, SGT values and emphasizes the strength of community wellness and youth initiatives. In a world that is growing increasingly more divisive, we strive to empower through unity. </p>

                  <p>SGT values action and transparency, meaning that donations we receive without allocation to a specific cause will be invested into expanding the full capacity of our website as well as volunteer opportunities across the GTA. </p>
